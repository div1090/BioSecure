This folder contains the code for the backend webservice

Currently the webservice supports 2 RESTfull API methods:

Enroll - to enroll a new user 
Verify - to obtain the score of the current image against the enrolled user

To perform the face recognition, VGG Face Descriptor using Caffe is used.

The caffe installation is assumed to be separate, however the code for obtaining the VGG features is part of the project.
Also the caffe model used can be found under vgg_caffe_model
