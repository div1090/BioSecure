The app uses [Google's Mobile Vision API](https://developers.google.com/android/reference/com/google/android/gms/vision/face/package-summary) for Face Detection which is bundled with the front-end. It uses a pre-trained [VGGFace](http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/software/vgg_face/) model built with caffe for Face Recognition served over REST API as the backend server.
